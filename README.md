# Predicting-Covid-Mortality-with-Machine-Learning

• Download the Covid-19 dataset from the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset
The dataset is online and publicly available with a free Kaggle account.


• This dataset was released by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it contains information the Covid-19 cases in South Korea. The aim of the final project is to predict mortality among confirmed CoVID-19 patients in South Korea using logistic regression and support vector machines.

(1) Use 80% of data as the training data and 20% of data as the test data. 
Train two models: one based on logistic regression and one based on support vector machines. 
We compared their performances on the test data. There's a similar approach to the following paper:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7528809/pdf/peerj-08-10083.pdf [Predicting CoVID-19 community mortality risk using machine learning and development of an online prognostic tool, 2020] by Das et al.

(2) We explained models and visualized classifiers. We also made tables that summarizes our classification errors for both of models.
